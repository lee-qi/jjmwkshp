# JJM Workshop

## Agenda
### Day 1: Basic running examples
1. Introduction to the jjm model (Link here)
1. Running the model from start to finish
    1. Data input (ALK excel files)
    1. Data input into JJM
    1. Model setting, Model equations, Parameters (refer to technical annex)
    1. Running the 2021 assessment
    1. Updating input data
    1. Updating control file
    1. Single-stock vs two-stock models

### Day 2: Outputs and Diagnostics
1. Understanding the Outputs
    1. Ascii files (difference between standard ADMB output and specialized ones for JJM)
    1. JJM outputs (standard) 
    1. Pulling out important quantities from the jjm object (e.g. MSY table)
    1. Making plots from JJM (custom)
    1. Stock status under different regimes
1. Generating new plots for diagnostic purposes
1. Retrospective analysis

### Day 3: Sensitivity analyses and model comparisons
1. Sensitivities in data â€“ e.g. include/drop data 
    1. Replacing CPUE indices
    1. Replacing age composition data
1. Sensitivities in model settings
    1. Changing individual parameters
1. Comparing model runs
    1. Current diagnostics available
    1. Making custom diagnostics
