# Data Bridging

- When data are added incrementally to the assessment

- Used to be done by hand

    - Annotated Excel spreadsheet found [here](https://southpacificrfmo.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/SPRFMOSC8/EXbb-znBI91FiUeMF-8BpTkBkl_8cbt5pKpl3XcU8wRTJA?e=VW0d1j) (SC8; with highlighted changes) and [here](https://github.com/SPRFMO/jjm/blob/master/assessment/data/JM%20Data%20files%20for%20SC09.xlsx) (SC9; without highlighted changes but with accompanying R file; also in `jjm/assessment/data`)

- Since SC9, there's an R script to do it

    - [`jjm/assessment/R/SC09_Bridging.R`](https://github.com/SPRFMO/jjm/blob/master/assessment/R/SC09_Bridging.R)

    - Goes from 0.00 to 1.00 for both single-stock and two-stock hypotheses

- For every data point you add to a time series (e.g. for catch or for index data), a corresponding error term must be added.
  
    - Don't forget to increment the number of years (`Inumyears` and `Iyears`) for the indices

    - Index error is computed by multiplying the index value with the CV (from technical annex)

- When adding a data point to composition data, the `numyears`, `years`, and `sample` need to be incremented as well.

    - Sample size for composition data gets incremented, but the final data point for each fleet is downweighted


- Reminder: weight at age is required for every fleet in every year of the model

    - Historically, when the year is updated but not the weight-at-age data (e.g. if the weight at age for a particular fleet is unavailable at the time of the SC), the previous year's data are used.

- For each new data file created, a corresponding control file will have to be made as well. The control files during the data bridging exercise remain relatively static, except for changing the name of the data file and adding the one extra year at the top.

# Updating the Control File

- Increments years used to estimate the stock-recruitment relationship by 1

# Exercises (using either Excel or R)
- Add one year of catch data (as was done in the bridging exercise for `0.04` to `0.05`) to the 2021 data file (`1.00.dat`). Run the model with the updated data file.

- Update the control file from 2021 (`h1_1.00.ctl` and `h2_1.00`) for 2022. Run the updated 2022 model.

- (If you have time) Go through the SC9 model runs and select a couple of models from the table to recreate.

# Debugging Tips and Tricks
- If you've edited the input files and the model seems to be giving nonsensical results, it might be that you've missed number or a line in the input.

    - Ideally check the `input.log` file, as mentioned in the RunningModel document.
    - The control file contains a "Test" value at the end. This acts as a check that the control file was read in correctly.

    ```{r}
    #Test  
    123456789  
    ```
