# Data Bridging
Show Excel spreadsheet for building input files


Go through `jjm/assessment/R/SC09_Bridging.R`?


# Exercises
- Add one year of catch data (as was done in the bridging exercise for `0.04` to `0.05`) to the 2021 data file (`1.00.dat`)

- Update the control file from 2021 (`h1_1.00.ctl` and `h2_1.00`) for 2022 

# Debugging Tips and Tricks
- If you edited the input files and the model seems to be giving nonsensical results, it might be that you've missed number or a line in the input.
